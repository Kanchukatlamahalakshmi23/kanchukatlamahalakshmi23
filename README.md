✅ Hi, I'm Mahalakshmi, a recent B.Tech graduate with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. I am passionate about leveraging my skills in Python and machine learning to build intelligent systems that solve complex, real-world challenges.
✅ My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in AI principles and hands-on project experience. My key project involved Managing Fraud Detection in Mobile Social Networks, where I applied graph-based analysis with NetworkX and classification models with Scikit-learn to identify fraudulent user accounts with 85% accuracy.
✅ I have a comprehensive understanding of key areas in the field, including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data Analysis. My primary tools include Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Pandas.
✅ I am a dedicated and quick learner, constantly seeking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in AI. I am currently deepening my knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) and MLOps best practices. In my free time, I enjoy exploring innovative AI applications and learning new technologies.
✅I am actively seeking full-time Machine Learning Engineer and NLP Engineer roles starting in 2025. I am a dedicated and quick learner, eager to contribute to a collaborative team and apply my skills to develop impactful technology.
